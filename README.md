# Retaliation Security Prevention

Inside of this software you may find a multitude of "backdoors". These are not meant for malicious intents to base users or servers. What you see is not meant for those that abide by Discord ToS. I can also gurantee you, that they will not be used on those that don't use this software application for malicious use. What you're finding is services used to stop what is called "leakers". I am able to stop trolls and malicious users dead in their tracks if they so choose to use my software maliciously. Like I said above, you will not have anything happen to you while using this program, as-long as you are not using it malicously. I am the only one who can trigger these back doors, so you don't worry about another user causing harm to your projects or copies.

`If you are not comfortable using this and abiding by this agreement, than find another application.`

- A), You don't have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) V16+ installed.
- B), You don't have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.

Installing these should fix this issue!

---

## Missing Permissions

Make sure your bot has Administrator permissions in it's roles, also make sure it is at the top of the roles list, see example below if you need a visual example.

---

## ECON Refused

You have to actually connect to a MySQL server.

---

## Discord Canvas Issue

It looks like a bunch of `Node GYP` Errors, and it is usually spammed in the console.

To fix this issue, follow the below guide.

- Delete the `node_modules` folder inside of the bot.
- Make sure you have updated to [NodeJS V16+](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Re-run the `CLIENT INSTALL.bat` file.
- Then try starting your bot with the provided client starter file.

---

## Unexpected Token ?

This error occurs when you're not on the latest required version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) (v16+ Required)

---

## Abort Controller

To fix this issue, or issues / errors relating to this, simply [update NodeJS to V16+](https://nodejs.org)

You can check your NodeJS Version by running `node -v` in command prompt, powershell, or terminal.

# Getting IDs

- Open your Discord settings
- Scroll down and find "Appearance"
- Scroll to the bottom and find "Developer Mode"
- Turn the switch on

---

# Port Requirement

The bot uses a port so it can simply detect whether or not it is online via a "status" page.

---

# Debug Mode

Debug mode is STRICTLY designed to show the errors the bot has. Most errors will not be sent in console while `debugmode` is set to `false`. This allows users to keep their console clean and collected!
